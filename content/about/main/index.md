  The bioinformatics platform has been launched in November 2020 to address needs of the LabEx CORTEX teams and proposes various expertise to support single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) projects :

  - Advice to set up new scRNA-seq projects (cell preparation, technology choice).
  
  - Bioinformatics analysis of scRNA-seq data (quality control, first level analysis).
  
  - Training in bioinformatics analysis tools.
  
  - Develop, maintain and share protocols and bioinformatics pipelines (data bases).

We also provide an interactive shiny app for visualizing public single-cell data bases.

The platform is headed by Guillaume Marcy with support of the steering committee: Val√©rie Castellani (INMG), Christelle Peyron (CRNL) and Olivier Raineteau (SBRI). It is located within the genomic platform ProfileXpert.
