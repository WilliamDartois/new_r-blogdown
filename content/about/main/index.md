  The Bioinformatics platform has been launched in November 2020 to address needs of the LabEx CORTEX teams and propose various expertise to support singe-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) projects :

  - Advice to set up new scRNA-seq projects (cell preparation, technology choice)
  
  - Bioinformatics analysis of scRNA-seq data (quality control, first level analysis)
  
  - Training in bioinformatics analysis tools
  
  - Develop, maintain and share protocols and bioinformatics pipelines (data bases)
