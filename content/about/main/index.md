  Sequencing technologies are improving days and days, and bioinformatic is becoming more and more important in sciences research.
  
  Therefore, this section has been launched in order to address needs of the LabEx CORTEX teams and propose various expertise to support singe-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) projects :

  - Advice to set up new scRNA-seq projects (cell preparation, technology choice).
  
  - Bioinformatics analysis of scRNA-seq data (quality control, first level analysis).
  
  - Training in bioinformatics analysis tools.
  
  - Develop, maintain and share protocols and bioinformatics pipelines (data bases).
